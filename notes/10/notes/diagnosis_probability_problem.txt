A patient takes a lab test and the result comes back positive. The test has a false 
negative rate of 2% and false positive rate of 2%. Furthermore, 0.5% of the entire 
population have this cancer.

What is the probability of cancer if we know the test result is positive?


P(cancer|testpostive) = P(cancer n testpositive) / P(testpositive)

Now imagine that 10,000 tests for cancer are administered. Of these, how many are 
positive? 

On the average, 50 of these 10,000 people (.5 percent of 10,000) will have cancer, 
and so, since 98 percent of them will test positive, we will have 49 positive tests. 

Of the 9,950 cancerless people, 2 percent of them will test positive, for a total of 
199 positive tests (.02 x 9,950 = 199). 

Thus, of the total 248 positive tests (199 + 49 = 248), most (199) are false 
positives, and so the conditional probability of having cancer given that one tests 
positive is only 49/248, or about 20 percent! (This relatively low percentage is to 
be contrasted with the conditional probability that one tests positive, given that 
one has cancer, which by assumption is 98 percent.)
